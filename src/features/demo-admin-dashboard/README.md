# Demo Admin Dashboard

This folder contains the isolated demo-admin dashboard slice for maintainers who need to populate and review fake demo UI data. It intentionally avoids production mail flows, live network calls, real user records, and route/app-shell integration.

Contributors working on demo-admin issues should keep new dashboard code, local state helpers, fixtures, validators, UI components, test utilities, and documentation inside:

`src/features/demo-admin-dashboard/`

The rest of the app should only import stable entry points from this folder once the feature is ready to connect to the demo inbox. Avoid changing existing inbox, mail reader, calendar, sender-conversion, or protocol modules unless an issue explicitly asks for a minimal integration shim.

Primary goals:

- Create a safe admin surface for loading demo inbox data.
- Keep demo data editing separate from production mail flows.
- Make every demo data mutation previewable, reversible, and auditable.
- Provide fixtures and validation that keep the demo UI realistic and stable.

## Responsive Width Notes

| Width         | Breakpoint | Layout rule                                           | Review expectation                                               |
| ------------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 768px–1023px  | Tablet     | One-column data cards with controls stacked first     | No horizontal scrolling; touch controls remain above data cards. |
| 1024px–1439px | Laptop     | Two-column data cards plus a compact review rail      | Cards balance across two columns and width notes stay visible.   |
| 1440px+       | Desktop    | Three-column data cards plus an expanded review panel | Maintainers can scan data areas and layout checks side by side.  |

## Layout Checks

- Controls precede data cards on tablet widths.
- Laptop widths use a two-up card grid without requiring unrelated app-shell changes.
- Desktop widths keep responsive review notes visible next to the card grid.

## Validation

Run the unit tests:

```bash
npm run test
```

Or target just the admin dashboard unit tests:

```bash
npx vitest run src/features/demo-admin-dashboard/__tests__/
```

The fixture data in `fixtures/demoData.ts` and `fixtures/campaignSnapshotFixtures.ts` is deterministic, fake, and safe for public repository review.

## Integration

The `DemoAdminDashboard` component is exported from `./index.ts`. It is a self-contained shell that manages its own tab state and renders deterministic fake data.

### Usage

```tsx
import { DemoAdminDashboard } from "@/features/demo-admin-dashboard";

// Mount it anywhere a full-height admin surface is needed:
<DemoAdminDashboard className="h-screen" />;
```

### Props

| Prop        | Type     | Default | Description                          |
| ----------- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `className` | `string` | `""`    | CSS class forwarded to the root node |

### Sections

The dashboard exposes these tabbed sections:

| Section   | Description                                                    |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Overview  | Summary stats cards (accounts, messages, etc.)                 |
| Accounts  | Table of demo Stellar accounts                                 |
| Mail      | Table of demo mail fixtures                                    |
| Templates | Pick a message template and insert it into the active drafts   |
| Campaigns | Save current drafts as a snapshot or restore previous campaign |
| Audit     | Timeline of demo protocol events                               |

## Message templates (`./templates`)

The **Templates** section renders `TemplatePicker`: an admin surface for choosing a pre-written message template and inserting it into the draft dataset that will populate the demo inbox.

- `templates/messageTemplates.ts` — deterministic, fake template fixtures. Recipients use the reserved `*stealth.demo` handle or `example.com`/`example.org` domains so nothing references real people or live addresses (a test enforces this).
- `templates/templateSearch.ts` — `searchTemplates(templates, query)` is a ranked, case-insensitive substring search (name/subject hits outrank tag/description hits).
- `templates/templateToDraft.ts` — pure, non-mutating helpers that map a template onto the existing `Draft` shape (`./types/draft`) and `insertTemplate` / `removeDraft` the dataset, with duplicate-insert validation.
- `templates/TemplatePicker.tsx` — searchable list, detail preview (subject, recipients, body, tags), an **Insert draft** action that disables once a template is in the dataset, and the running draft dataset with per-row remove.

---

## Campaign Snapshots (`./components/CampaignSnapshots.tsx`)

The **Campaigns** section renders `CampaignSnapshots`: an admin interface for taking snapshots of the currently built draft dataset, listing saved campaign snapshots, displaying detailed metadata, and restoring previous campaign draft states.

- **Snapshots List**: Renders saved campaign snapshots (preloaded defaults and custom ones) with metadata (name, description, target audience, tags, timestamp, and contained drafts count/subjects).
- **Save Snapshot**: Allows saving the active draft dataset as a new campaign snapshot with custom name, description, target audience, and tags.
- **Restore Confirmation**: Restoring a snapshot prompts a confirmation alert detailing the active/target draft counts to prevent accidental overwrite of active draft states.
- **Persistence**: Active draft dataset and campaign snapshots are saved in browser's local storage under unique namespaces (`demoAdminDraftDataset` and `demoAdminCampaignSnapshots`), falling back to default snapshots if empty.

---

## Campaign Display Tokens (`./constants/displayTokens.ts`)

Display tokens are folder-local constants used to color-code campaign statuses, tag keywords, and target audiences.

- **Status Tokens**: Mapping for `"active"`, `"draft"`, `"needs-review"`, and `"archived"` statuses.
- **Tag Tokens**: Semantic colors for specific update categories (`"onboarding"`, `"welcome"`, `"stellar"`, `"security"`, `"alert"`, `"newsletter"`, `"marketing"`, `"announcement"`), with custom inputs falling back to neutral styles.
- **Audience Tokens**: Styles for target segments (`"New Signups"`, `"High-Value Accounts"`, `"Newsletter Subscribers"`), falling back to a purple theme for arbitrary custom groups.
- **Interactive Documentation**: A collapsible panel displaying examples of all tokens with real-time badge renderings is embedded directly at the bottom of the Campaigns tab.

### Follow-up integration (out of scope here)

Connecting the produced active `Draft[]` to the live demo inbox (e.g. dispatching `loadDraft` into the shared `draftReducer`, or seeding `src/components/mail/data.ts`) is a deliberate follow-up so that no files outside `src/features/demo-admin-dashboard/` change here.
